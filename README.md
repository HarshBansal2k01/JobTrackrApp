# JobTracker 🚀

## Overview 🎯

**JobTracker** helps you keep track of the jobs you have applied for and the stages of the application process. It is divided into three parts:

1. **Applied** 📄: Jobs you have applied for.
2. **In Process** 🔄: Jobs you are currently being considered for, with an option to add the specific process stage you are in.
3. **Completed** ✅: Jobs for which the application process is finished.

This helps job seekers not to lose track of their applications.
